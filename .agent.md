# Workspace notes

- Test Driven Development (TDD) Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where you: - Write a failing test for the functionality you plan to implement. - Implement just enough code to pass this test. - Refactor the code for clarity or efficiency without changing its behavior.
- use uv for all python related commands especially testing, enviorment and others
