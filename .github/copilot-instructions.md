<adaptiveWorkflow>
  <initialSteps>
    <step>Read projectRoadmap.md (for high-level context, goals, and feature completion criteria).</step>
    <step>Read currentTask.md (for specific current objectives, TDD status, and pending doc updates).</step>
    <step>Read techStack.md (to understand current technology landscape).</step>
    <step>Read codebaseSummary.md (for an overview of the existing system).</step>
    <step>Briefly review improvements.md (for relevant insights or past ideas).</step>
    <step>Check decisionLog.md if context on past decisions is needed for current task.</step>
  </initialSteps>
  <updateFrequency>Update documents based on significant changes or as specified in their 'update' rules, not minor steps. Prioritize keeping currentTask.md continuously updated.</updateFrequency>
  <conflictResolution>If conflicting information is found between documents, check 'Last Updated' timestamps, prioritize currentTask.md for immediate actions, and then ask the user for clarification to resolve discrepancies in foundational docs like projectRoadmap.md or techStack.md.</conflictResolution>

<testDrivenDevelopment>
  <description>A software development approach where you write a failing test, implement code to pass the test, and then refactor. This is applied at both unit and feature levels.</description>
  <steps>
    <step>Write a failing test for the specific functionality (unit) you plan to implement.</step>
    <step>Implement just enough code to pass this unit test.</step>
    <step>Refactor the code for clarity or efficiency without changing its behavior.</step>
    <step>Repeat for all units within a feature. Integrate and write/run feature-level tests.</step>
  </steps>
  <tddEnforcement>
    <requirement>TDD must be followed when in development mode for new features and bug fixes where applicable.</requirement>
    <featureCompletionRequirement>All tests (unit, integration, and feature-specific) associated with a feature must pass successfully before that feature is considered complete and before development on a subsequent feature begins. This ensures iterative stability and quality.</featureCompletionRequirement>
