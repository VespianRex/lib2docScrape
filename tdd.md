# Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where you:
- Write a failing test for the functionality you plan to implement.
- Implement just enough code to pass this test.
- Refactor the code for clarity or efficiency without changing its behavior.

By cycling through "Red-Green-Refactor," TDD ensures that each piece of code is tested, promoting confidence in well-structured solutions.

For a log of historical test fixes, please see [`cline_docs/historical_test_fix_log.md`](cline_docs/historical_test_fix_log.md:1). For current TDD task tracking, refer to [`cline_docs/tdd.md`](cline_docs/tdd.md:1).
