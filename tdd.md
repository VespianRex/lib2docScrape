# Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where you:
- Write a failing test for the functionality you plan to implement.  
- Implement just enough code to pass this test.  
- Refactor the code for clarity or efficiency without changing its behavior.

By cycling through "Red-Green-Refactor," TDD ensures that each piece of code is tested, promoting confidence in well-structured solutions.
