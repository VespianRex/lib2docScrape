# Test Strategy and Status

**Last Updated: 2025-01-27 15:45**

## Overview
This document consolidates all test-related planning and status for the lib2docScrape project. After successfully fixing all failing tests, we now have a solid foundation for continued development.

## Current Test Status

### ✅ **MAJOR SUCCESS: All Tests Passing**
- **Total Tests**: 598 tests
- **Status**: 598 passed, 0 failed
- **Coverage**: Overall 21% (needs improvement)
- **Last Full Run**: 2025-01-27

### Recently Fixed Tests
- [x] `test_url_info_components_match_urlparse` - Fixed URLInfo fragment property
- [x] `test_validate_port` - Corrected port validation expectations  
- [x] Performance test metrics isolation - Added autouse fixtures
- [x] `test_fragment_removal` - Updated test expectations
- [x] All rate limiting and throttling tests - Fixed metrics isolation

## Test Coverage Analysis

### High Coverage Areas (>70%)
- Core URL processing functionality
- Basic backend operations
- Configuration management

### Medium Coverage Areas (30-70%)
- Content processing
- Quality checking
- Document organization

### Low Coverage Areas (<30%) - Priority for Improvement
- `src/backends/` - 12-30% coverage
- `src/main.py` - Various components need coverage
- `src/ui/` modules - UI components need testing
- Integration tests between components
- Error handling and edge cases

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- **Location**: `tests/`
- **Purpose**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Status**: Comprehensive for core utilities, needs expansion for backends
- **Command**: `uv run pytest tests/ -v`

### Integration Tests  
- **Location**: `tests/integration/`
- **Purpose**: Test component interactions
- **Status**: Basic coverage, needs expansion
- **Focus Areas**: Backend-processor integration, end-to-end workflows

### Property-Based Tests
- **Location**: `tests/property/`
- **Purpose**: Test properties and invariants
- **Status**: Good coverage for URL handling
- **Tool**: Hypothesis for property-based testing

### Performance Tests
- **Location**: `tests/utils/test_performance*.py`
- **Purpose**: Verify performance characteristics
- **Status**: Recently fixed, all passing
- **Focus**: Rate limiting, throttling, memoization

## Testing Tools and Commands

### Primary Test Runner
```bash
uv run pytest                    # Run all tests
uv run pytest --maxfail=5       # Stop after 5 failures (incremental approach)
uv run pytest --cov             # Run with coverage
uv run pytest -v                # Verbose output
uv run pytest -x                # Stop on first failure
```

### Coverage Analysis
```bash
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html    # Generate HTML coverage report
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term    # Terminal coverage report
```

### Linting and Quality
```bash
uv run ruff check src/           # Code linting
uv run ruff format src/          # Code formatting
```

## Test Development Guidelines

### TDD Workflow
1. **Red**: Write failing test for new functionality
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass test
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests passing

### Test Quality Standards
- Tests should verify real functionality, not just pass
- Focus on meaningful validation of behavior
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Maintain test isolation (no shared state)
- Use descriptive test names and clear assertions

### Performance Test Guidelines
- Use autouse fixtures to reset metrics between tests
- Test real-world scenarios, not just synthetic cases
- Verify both correctness and performance characteristics
- Include timeout and resource usage validation

## Future Test Priorities

### Phase 1: Backend Coverage (High Priority)
- Expand backend test coverage from current 12-30% to >70%
- Test all backend implementations thoroughly
- Add integration tests between backends and processors

### Phase 2: UI and Main Module Coverage (Medium Priority)  
- Add comprehensive UI component tests
- Test main.py functionality and CLI interfaces
- Add end-to-end workflow tests

### Phase 3: Advanced Testing (Low Priority)
- Add stress testing for high-load scenarios
- Implement chaos testing for resilience
- Add performance regression testing
- Expand property-based testing coverage

## Test Infrastructure

### Fixtures and Utilities
- Comprehensive fixture library for test data
- Mock backends for isolated testing
- Performance metrics reset utilities
- Test data generators and factories

### CI/CD Integration
- All tests must pass before merging
- Coverage reports generated automatically
- Performance regression detection
- Automated test result reporting

## Archived Test Plans
The following test planning documents have been consolidated into this strategy:
- `test_coverage_plan_phase1_zero_percent.md` → Archived
- `test_coverage_plan_phase2_low_coverage.md` → Archived  
- `test_coverage_plan_phase3_more_low_coverage.md` → Archived
- `test_fix_comprehensive_plan.md` → Archived
- `test_fix_plan.md` → Archived

## Success Metrics

### Short Term (Next Sprint)
- [ ] Maintain 100% test pass rate
- [ ] Increase backend coverage to >50%
- [ ] Add 20+ new meaningful tests

### Medium Term (Next Month)
- [ ] Achieve >40% overall coverage
- [ ] Complete backend test coverage improvement
- [ ] Add comprehensive integration test suite

### Long Term (Next Quarter)
- [ ] Achieve >70% overall coverage
- [ ] Complete UI test coverage
- [ ] Implement automated performance testing
- [ ] Add comprehensive end-to-end test scenarios

## Notes
- Prefer `uv run pytest --maxfail=5` for incremental testing approach
- Focus on meaningful tests that verify real functionality
- All experimental code and implementations should be preserved
- Test coverage improvements should be done incrementally
- Performance tests require careful metrics isolation
