🟢 GREEN: Fixed test_generate_search_queries_library_without_version in test_crawler.py

**Last Updated:** 2025-06-05 00:35

**FIXED FAILING TESTS:**

1. **test_single_url_processing** in test_crawler.py:
   - 🔴 RED: The test was failing because it was mocking `_fetch_and_process_with_backend` to return 3 values but `_process_url` expected 4 values
   - 🟢 GREEN: Updated the mocked function to return a 4th value (empty metrics dictionary)
   - ✅ TEST PASSES: The test now passes without any issues

2. **test_generate_search_queries_library_without_version** in test_crawler.py:
   - 🔴 RED: The test was failing because `_generate_search_queries` was only returning `"{base_name} documentation"` for libraries without versions, but the test expected "api reference", "tutorial", and "guide" queries as well
   - 🟢 GREEN: Updated the method to add these additional queries for libraries without versions
   - ✅ TEST PASSES: The test now passes, properly generating all expected search queries
