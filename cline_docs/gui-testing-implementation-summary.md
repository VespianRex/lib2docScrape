## 🏗️ Technical Implementation Details

### **Playwright Configuration**
- **Test Directory**: `tests/e2e/`
- **Base URL**: Configurable (default: localhost:60643)
- **Parallel Execution**: Enabled for faster testing
- **Retry Logic**: Configured for CI environments
- **Reporting**: HTML, JSON, and JUnit formats

### **Web Server Integration**
- **Command**: `uv run python run_gui.py --port 60643`
- **Automatic Management**: Server starts before tests, stops after
- **Port Configuration**: Configurable and conflict-free
- **Timeout Handling**: 120-second startup timeout

### **Test Organization**
- **Modular Structure**: Separate files for different components
- **Reusable Patterns**: Common test utilities and helpers
- **Clear Naming**: Descriptive test and file names
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive comments and descriptions

## 🎯 Key Benefits Achieved

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Real Browser Testing**: Tests run in actual browsers, not simulations
