# Current Task: Achieve Full Test Coverage (Three-Phase Plan)

**Primary Objective:**  
Execute the comprehensive test coverage improvement plan, working through all subtasks in the following order:

1. [`cline_docs/test_coverage_plan_phase1_zero_percent.md`](cline_docs/test_coverage_plan_phase1_zero_percent.md) â€” Phase 1: Files with 0% coverage  
2. [`cline_docs/test_coverage_plan_phase2_low_coverage.md`](cline_docs/test_coverage_plan_phase2_low_coverage.md) â€” Phase 2: Files with low (but >0%) coverage  
3. [`cline_docs/test_coverage_plan_phase3_more_low_coverage.md`](cline_docs/test_coverage_plan_phase3_more_low_coverage.md) â€” Phase 3: Additional low coverage files

## Workflow & Rules

- **At the start of each subtask:**  
  - Check the relevant phase plan file for the next incomplete subtask.
  - Work through the subtasks in order, one at a time.
- **After completing each subtask:**  
  - Mark the subtask as complete in the corresponding plan file.
  - Update this tally/progress section.
- **Each boomerang task must finish by marking the completed subtask in the coverage plan doc.**
- **Always check the plan files for the next subtask before proceeding.**

## Progress Tally

- **Phase 1:** [`test_coverage_plan_phase1_zero_percent.md`](cline_docs/test_coverage_plan_phase1_zero_percent.md)
  - [x] `src/base.py` â€” No testable code remains. Marked complete.
  - [x] `src/crawler.py` - `CrawlTarget` model tests completed.
  - [x] `src/crawler.py` - `CrawlStats` model tests completed.
  - [ ] Remaining: `src/crawler.py` (remaining models and `DocumentationCrawler` class), `src/ui/doc_viewer_complete.py`

- **Phase 2:** [`test_coverage_plan_phase2_low_coverage.md`](cline_docs/test_coverage_plan_phase2_low_coverage.md)
  - [ ] All subtasks complete

- **Phase 3:** [`test_coverage_plan_phase3_more_low_coverage.md`](cline_docs/test_coverage_plan_phase3_more_low_coverage.md)
  - [ ] All subtasks complete

---

## TDD Status

- **Current Stage:** ðŸ”´ RED (Write a failing test for the next uncovered path)
- **Next Step:**  
  - Identify the next uncovered line/branch/subtask from the phase plan files.
  - Write a failing test for it.
  - Implement code to pass the test, then refactor as needed.

---

## Pending Doc Updates

- Update `projectRoadmap.md` and `codebaseSummary.md` as phases or major milestones are completed.
- Mark completed subtasks in the relevant coverage plan files after each boomerang task.
