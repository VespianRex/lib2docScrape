# Current Task: Comprehensive Testing and Intelligent Backend Selection

**Last Updated: 2025-01-28 00:15**

**Primary Objective:**
Implement comprehensive tests for all new functionality and create an intelligent backend selection system based on performance metrics.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 5: Comprehensive Testing (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Test all new UI Doc Viewer functionality
- [ ] Test document organizer version limiting
- [ ] Test export functionality (JSON, CSV, XML)
- [ ] Test enhanced Scrapy backend processing and validation
- [ ] Test AsciiDoc processing enhancements
- [ ] Test GUI elements and interactions
- [ ] Achieve near 100% test coverage for new functionality

### Phase 6: Intelligent Backend Selection System (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Design backend performance metrics collection system
- [ ] Implement metrics recording for all backends
- [ ] Create backend selection algorithm based on resource usage
- [ ] Implement website-specific backend recommendations
- [ ] Add configuration for backend selection preferences
- [ ] Test the intelligent selection system

### Phase 7: Integration and Optimization (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Integrate backend selection with existing crawler
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and reporting
- [ ] Implement caching for backend selection decisions
- [ ] Add GUI controls for backend selection preferences

## Current Status
- **Phase**: 5 - Comprehensive Testing
- **Progress**: Starting TDD implementation of tests for new functionality

## Summary of Completed Work

### ðŸŽ¯ **Major Accomplishments**
1. **Removed 4 duplicate/redundant files** - Cleaned up codebase significantly
2. **Fixed 4 major placeholder implementations** - Real functionality now available
3. **Standardized architecture** - Consistent import patterns and better organization
4. **Enhanced features** - AsciiDoc processing, export functionality, validation

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Improvements**
- **UI Doc Viewer**: Replaced placeholder with real DocumentOrganizer integration
- **Document Organizer**: Added proper version limiting with configurable max versions
- **Test Routes**: Complete export functionality (JSON, CSV, XML) with error handling
- **Scrapy Backend**: Enhanced content processing and comprehensive validation
- **AsciiDoc Handler**: Full parsing for headings, code blocks, links, images, lists

### ðŸ§¹ **Code Quality**
- **Import Standardization**: Converted absolute imports to relative imports
- **Coverage Configuration**: Updated to reflect removed files
- **Dependency Management**: All imports properly updated and tested
- **Architecture**: Eliminated circular dependencies and improved modularity

### âœ… **Verification**
- All changes tested with passing unit tests
- Import structure verified with successful module loading
- Key functionality validated across multiple test files

## TDD Status
- **Current Stage:** ï¿½ RED: Writing failing tests for new functionality
- **Next**: Implement comprehensive test coverage for all new features
- **Focus**: UI Doc Viewer, Export functionality, Backend selection system
