## Archive Policy

Documents are moved to the `archive/` directory when:
- They represent completed phases of work
- They have been superseded by newer, consolidated documents
- They are historical logs that are no longer actively referenced
- They contain outdated information that might cause confusion

Archived documents are preserved for historical reference and lessons learned.
