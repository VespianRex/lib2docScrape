This document serves as an append-only log summarizing key objectives and outcomes from previous planning documents. Original detailed plan files are typically deleted after their essence is captured here.

**Last Updated:** May 12, 2025

## Initiative: Critical Crawler Bug Fix (AttributeError)
*   **Original Plan(s) Referenced:** `cline_docs/debug_plan_crawler.md` (Phase 1), `cline_docs/codebaseSummary.md` ("Recent Significant Changes" May 2025)
*   **Date of Completion:** Approx May 2025
*   **Key Completed Objectives:**
    *   Resolved critical `AttributeError: 'CrawlResult' object has no attribute 'documents'` in `src/crawler.py` by changing document access from `result_data.documents` to `result_data.content.get("documents", [])`.
    *   This fix addressed issues related to the two different `CrawlResult` Pydantic models (one in `src/backends/base.py` and one in `src/crawler.py`).

## Initiative: URL Handling Refactor (Modularization & Enhancements)
*   **Original Plan(s) Referenced:** `url_refactor_plan.md` (superseded), `cline_docs/refactoring_plan_info_py.md`, `url_refactor_modular_plan.md` (Phases 1 & 2), `cline_docs/tdd.md`, `cline_docs/codebaseSummary.md`, `recommendations.md` (Item 1), `tdd.md` (root log entry for 2025-04-15)
*   **Date of Completion:** Approx April-May 2025
*   **Key Completed Objectives:**
    *   Consolidated and modularized URL parsing, validation, normalization, security, and type determination logic into the `src/utils/url/` package (modules: `info.py`, `factory.py`, `validation.py`, `normalization.py`, `security.py`, `types.py`, `domain_parser.py`, `resolution.py`, `type_determiner.py`).
    *   Introduced `URLInfo` class (created via `src/utils/url/factory.py::create_url_info`) as the primary interface for URL handling.
    *   Integrated `tldextract` library for enhanced and accurate domain parsing.
    *   Implemented robust IDN handling.
    *   Updated `src/backends/selector.py` to use the new `URLInfo` class.
    *   Removed old/monolithic URL handling code (e.g., `src/utils/url_info.py` (old version), `src/utils/url_utils.py`, URL functions in `src/base.py`, `src/models/url.py`).
    *   Updated numerous tests to align with the new URL handling system. All related tests are now passing.

## Initiative: General Test Suite Stabilization and Warning Resolution
*   **Original Plan(s) Referenced:** `docs/TestSolvingPlan.md`, `cline_docs/test_fix_plan.md`, `tdd.md` (root log), `cline_docs/codebaseSummary.md` ("Recent Significant Changes" May 2025)
*   **Date of Completion:** Approx March-May 2025
*   **Key Completed Objectives:**
    *   Addressed a large number of test failures (approx 49 initially reported in `docs/TestSolvingPlan.md`) across various modules including URL handling, crawler, content processor, and integration tests. All 392 tests are reported as passing as of May 12, 2025.
    *   Specific fixes included:
        *   Corrected URL normalization and validation logic and error messages.
        *   Fixed `URLInfo` property accessors and `tldextract` fallbacks.
        *   Resolved mocking issues in `crawl4ai` and integration tests.
        *   Corrected test setup errors (e.g., `test_validate_port`).
        *   Addressed `RuntimeWarning: coroutine was never awaited` in multiple files by adding `await`.
        *   Replaced `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)`.
        *   Replaced Pydantic `.dict()` with `.model_dump()`.
        *   Updated async fixtures to use `@pytest_asyncio.fixture`.
        *   Corrected Starlette `TemplateResponse` parameter order in `src/gui/app.py`.
        *   Fixed `max_pages` enforcement in `src/crawler.py`.
        *   Mocked DuckDuckGo API calls in `tests/test_crawler.py`.
        *   Ensured `Crawl4AIBackend` uses `RateLimiter` correctly.
    *   Implemented robust HTML sanitization using `bleach` in `src/processors/content_processor.py` (Ref: `recommendations.md` Item 2).

## Initiative: Content Processing Fixes
*   **Original Plan(s) Referenced:** `cline_docs/tdd.md`, `cline_docs/improvements.md`
*   **Date of Completion:** Prior to May 2025
*   **Key Completed Objectives:**
    *   Fixed code block language detection for "javascript" in `src/processors/content/code_handler.py`.
    *   Corrected ordered list formatting in `src/processors/content_processor.py`.
    *   Adjusted `test_heading_hierarchy` in `tests/test_content_processor_advanced.py` by configuring `max_heading_level`.
    *   Fixed `test_special_characters` in `tests/test_content_processor_advanced.py` by removing an invalid assertion.

---

## Initiative: Code & File Cleanup (Ongoing, Significant Progress)
*   **Original Plan(s) Referenced:** `CLEANUP.md`, `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` (analysis of OLD files), `recommendations.md` (Item 4)
*   **Date of Completion:** Ongoing, major review completed prior to May 2025
*   **Key Completed Objectives:**
    *   Reviewed numerous "OLD" files (as detailed in `CLEANUP.md`).
    *   Removed many redundant/superseded Python files from `src/` and `tests/` (e.g., `src/__init__OLD_347.py`, `src/apiOLD_892.py`, `src/baseOLD_156.py`, `src/content_processorOLD_734.py`, `src/backends/http.py`, `src/models/url.py`).
    *   The `src/backends/baseOLD_478.py` was identified as still in use and effectively became `src/backends/base.py`.
    *   Superseded `src/gui/templates/indexOLD.html` with current `templates/index.html`.
    *   Old test configurations (`tests/conftestOLD.py`, `tests/test_baseOLD.py`) and `pyprojectOLD.toml` were reviewed and their relevant functionalities are now part of the current testing setup.

## Initiative: Crawler `crawl()` Method Signature Refactor
*   **Original Plan(s) Referenced:** `cline_docs/refactor_crawl_signature_tests.md`
*   **Date of Completion:** Prior to May 2025 (as `tests/test_crawler_advanced.py` was already updated per the plan, and all tests now pass)
*   **Key Completed Objectives:**
    *   Refactored `DocumentationCrawler.crawl()` in `src/crawler.py` to accept individual target components as arguments instead of a `CrawlTarget` object, resolving a state leakage issue.
    *   Updated call sites in `tests/test_crawler_advanced.py`.
    *   (Assumed) Updated call sites in `tests/test_crawler.py`, `tests/test_integration.py`, `tests/test_integration_advanced.py` as all tests are passing.
